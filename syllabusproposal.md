# Syllabus Proposal



## Prerequisites

Include the need for some background knowledge in AI, data mining, ML, statistics or related field. I believe students with no prior knowledge in these areas even with advanced programming classes might feel lost in the class.

## Assessment

In order to incentivize bigger participation in the case studies maybe distribute 1 mark per case study with an accompanying 1 page report on it. 
Bringing the report to class will enrich discussions.

Maybe get rid of MidTerms all together in this class, the focus here becoming more on the research and debate side of things.



## Class Discord Group

Please keep using discord, both as a TA and as a student the experience on discord is just wonderful.


## Lessons:

I believe that when reaching Fairness and discussing fairness metrics a simple fairness algorithm such as reweighing (simple implementation) could be introduced, maybe even as a final homework.


## Project:

I think a draft would be interesting as a mid-point. We need to start working on the project on the date where the midterm is and halfway through we need to show something. Maybe a 2 page draft with the main points and ideas of what you want to explore together with some basic literature review.
